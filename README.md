# SportsAnalytics
I spend my free time crunching sports numbers, and I'll be uploading those projects here. These are totally random/experimental projects.
I'm getting all my data from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League . This person has done an awesome job writing scrapers as well as collecting and organising player and team level data for the last few seasons. This project of mine would be totally impossible without such a repository.
